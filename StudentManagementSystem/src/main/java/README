Files Included:

A3_DB_setup.sql            - creates database and table
pom.xml                    - creates dependencies - conencts driver
DatabaseConnection.java    - connects Database
applicationOperations.java - application functions


Steps to setup:
1.
In pgAdmin4, right click Database on the left hand side explorer and click 'create'.
Name this Database Assignment3. This is important because in our DatabaseConnection file we declared the url as < String url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/Assignment3";> .
If you would like to name the database something else just change <Assignment3> in that url to your specified name.

Next, right click your <Assignment3> database and click querytool.
From there, press the open file icon and naviagte to where you saved the A3_DB_setup.sql file and open it.
Run this file. it will create your table and fill it.
There are lines in this file that are commented out, they do serve certain purposes but are not required for the db to fucntion; read their explanations if you are interested in including them.



2. Open intelliJ, naviagte to the upper right hand main menu, select open
navigate to the project <StudentManagementSystem> - wherever you saved it and open it :


3. Next, update the following lines in DatabaseConnection.java :
lines 9 & 10 :
String username - change the value to your postgres username
String password - change the value to your postgres password

if you named your database something else in step 1 : -->
line 8 :  String url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/Assignment3";
change the <Assignemnt3> segment to what you named your database



4. Run the application
select the applicationOperations file
to run the application either
- in the upper right hand corner of the window press the trinagle to run the application

OR

- right click applicationoperations.java file and select <Run applicationOperations.main()>

and the program will perform the operations on the table - we can see this in the output in intellij
